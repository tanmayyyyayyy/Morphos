/**
 * File README
 * What this file does: turns the entire workflow into a final explanation suitable for the frontend and API response.
 * Why it exists: the end user needs a crisp summary with evidence, confidence, and next steps.
 * Data in: the chosen hypothesis, experiment metadata, confidence, and result summary.
 * Data out: finalConclusion and the finalized status.
 * LangGraph connection: it is the terminal node reached when the confidence gate decides the investigation is complete.
